      <h2>1. "Accidental" Steam/Discord Report & Impersonation</h2>
      <p>A common scam is if a user claims you've been accidentally/falsely reported to Steam or Discord for an infraction or fraud.</p>
      <p>Don't follow instructions provided by anyone claiming to have accidentally reported your account.</p>
      <p>The most common things that identify this scam are if someone:</p>
      <p>• Says your account has been falsely or accidentally reported.</p>
      <p>• Directs you to speak with someone through online chat to resolve an investigation or pending ban.</p>
      <p>• Requests your account credentials or directs you to perform specific security-related operations.</p>
      <p>• Requests an authentication code sent over email, SMS, or anywhere else.</p>
      <p>• Says they represent Discord, Steam/Valve, or any other official entity.</p>
      <p>• Says you must complete a purchase of  any  kind.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p></p>
      <h2>2. Free Nitro Scams</h2>
      <p>If you believe you have received a possible scam from a bot or user account, consider if they:</p>
      <p>• Are new, unfamiliar, or unverified (in the case of bot accounts) contacting you unprompted.</p>
      <p>• Are not from Discord in the form of an email or <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/360036118732" target="_blank">System-tagged account</a>.</p>
      <p>• Have poor grammar, spelling, or misuse of punctuation/capitalization.</p>
      <p>• Offer things that are "too good to be true."</p>
      <p>Official Discord gifting uses the discord.gift & discord.com domains and will generate a special embed, as <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360100559094/Screen_Shot_2021-01-19_at_5.32.44_PM.png" target="_blank">Example 1</a> and <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/1500001750501/Screen_Shot_2021-01-19_at_5.38.00_PM.png" target="_blank">Example 2</a></p>
      <p>Scams like these are not possible through the official browser/client pages/menus.</p>
      <p>• If these types of bots are repeatedly sending you messages, you can:</p>
      <p>Use Mutual Servers to determine the servers they share with you and disable Direct Messages from server members for those servers.</p>
      <p>• If you cannot find any shared servers, you can disable DMs from all servers under your User Settings</p>
      <p></p>
      <p></p>
      <h2>3. QR Codes, Fake Games, Programs, & Downloads</h2>
      <p>A user may pretend to be your friend or use a friend's compromised account to get you to download something.</p>
      <p>Consider if they want you to:</p>
      <p>• Scan a QR code</p>
      <p>• Check out a video</p>
      <p>• Test a game they made</p>
      <p>• Practice running code they wrote</p>
      <p>These are common forms of malicious behavior.</p>
      <p>If a user asks you to scan/download something or click an unknown link, this could give away your login information and/or allow a malicious program to enter your computer, which can also compromise your account.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p></p>
      <h2>4. Compromised Accounts</h2>
      <p>If your account sends these kinds of messages, your account has been compromised. If you...</p>
      <p>• downloaded and executed malware: You should try and use a different device entirely to change your password (e.g., your phone). You should <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/115004307527--Windows-Corrupt-Installation" target="_blank">follow these steps</a> to completely uninstall Discord, run a complete antivirus scan, and then re-install Discord. If your account is compromised again when logging in afterward, you may need to factory reset your computer.</p>
      <p>• entered your password into a malicious website: You should change your password.</p>
      <p>• something else: You should change your password.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p></p>
      <h2>5. Reporting Malicious Content/Behavior</h2>
